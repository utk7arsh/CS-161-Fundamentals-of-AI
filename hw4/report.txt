1. Consider the CNF generated from graph 1 with k = 3 colors (graph1 3.cnf). Is this SAT instance
satisfiable?
UNSATISFIABLE

2. Consider the CNF generated from graph 1 with k = 4 colors (graph1 4.cnf). Is this SAT instance
satisfiable?
SATISFIABLE 

3. What do the answers of these two SAT instances tell you about the graph coloring problem of the
above graph? Can you give a solution (a coloring assignment) to the graph coloring problem of graph
1 based on the results of RSat?
The graph is 4 colorable and not 3 colorable as per the RSat. This means that there are at least 4 colors
required to completely color the graph using distinct colors for every connected node. 
Lets have 4 colors A B C D
Lets start with node 6 give it color A
Then go to node 5 give it color B
Then node 1 give it color C
Then node 2 give it color B
Then node 7 give it color D
Then node 4 give it color D
Then node 3 give it color C
As we can see no 2 nodes in a edge have have same coloring. 
Therefore this is the solution for the graph 1 problem.  

4. Use a similar approach to solve the graph coloring problem of graph 2 in graph2.txt. What is the
minimum number of colors required to properly color this graph?
8 colors are required at least to properly color the graph
